				<p>Do you know what the worst thing is about trying to lose weight?</p>
				<p><strong>The loneliness.</strong></p>
				<p>Whenever you try to lose weight it seems like you are the only person in the world that is living this awkward life of watching what you eat, trying to find time to exercise, and reaching a goal that feels like it is a million miles away.</p>
				<p>It makes sense why so many women fail in their weight loss journeys.</p>
				<p>Nobody wants to feel alone.</p>
				<h2>The Steps Are the Easy Part</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Eat less carbs</li>
					<li>Eat more protein</li>
					<li>Load up on veggies</li>
					<li>Work out to build muscle</li>
					<li>Drink water</li>
					<li>Sleep</li>
				</ol>
				<p>The actual steps to lose weight are easy when you break them down like this. So are the steps for becoming a doctor or astronaut.</p>
				<p>But losing weight is more than a series of steps. It&rsquo;s a unique journey.</p>
				<p>One that is unique to you.</p>
				<p><strong>Nobody has your body or life.</strong> No diet or workout plan is going to take into account your daily schedule or how you feel on certain days.</p>
				<p>You don&rsquo;t need someone to tell you that you need to eat more veggies.</p>
				<p><strong>You need someone that is going to be there to support you because there will be bumps and roadblocks along the way.</strong></p>
				<p>If you&rsquo;ve set a record for the number of times someone has tried to lose weight then keep reading.</p>
				<p>Do you know this feeling: you love you, but you don&rsquo;t love your body.</p>
				<p>You know you deserve a better one for yourself but for some reason it just isn&rsquo;t happening.</p>
				<p>The pain and frustration, it sucks.</p>
				<p><strong>You can finally break the cycle of try and fail weight loss journeys.</strong></p>
				<p>What you need is support.</p>
				<p>You need to surround yourself with others experiencing the same things as you.</p>
				<p>A group of women that listen to your frustrations, answer your questions, and helped to push you along.</p>
				<p>Most women aren&rsquo;t missing the secret to losing weight. They&rsquo;re missing the support system to help them lose weight.</p>

					<p>Having a community of women following along on the same journey as me helped me lose 12lbs. in the first 6 weeks.</p>
					<p>I loved the fact that you didn&rsquo;t tell me what I had to eat like most diets, but gave me guidelines on the 100s of different meals that I could prepare for myself that wouldn&rsquo;t set me back.</p>

					<p>The fact that I lost 14lbs in the first 21 days should say enough about this program. I would love to say that it was because of the workout plan and eating right but without the support of the community I probably would&rsquo;ve quit after the first week.</p>
					<p>I don&rsquo;t need to sign up for this program again because you&rsquo;ve given me everything that I need but the fact you provide me with a chance to interact with others that share the same journey is something that I can&rsquo;t pass up.</p>
					<p>Expect to see me again next season!</p>

				<p>So I set out to create a program from women who have the drive to lose weight but also need to fall back on support when needed.</p>
				<p>A program that doesn&rsquo;t pin you into a corner with what you can eat.</p>
				<p>A program that keeps workouts interesting and diverse.</p>
				<h2>Say Hello to <span class="orange">Lose It, Leave It, Love It</span></h2>
				<p>There are 3 goals for this weight loss program:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Lose It</strong>. Lose the unwanted weight.</li>
					<li><strong>Leave It</strong>. You aren&rsquo;t losing the weight so you can find it again. Leave it behind forever.</li>
					<li><strong>Love It</strong>. Most importantly, you need to love the process of losing weight and the results that you achieve.</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>What&rsquo;s Included</h3>
				<p>This is a 12-week program but you can start seeing results in as little as 3 days.</p>
				<p>So why is it 12 weeks? Because if you want to <strong>Leave It Off</strong> then you need to build up good habits. That can&rsquo;t be done in a couple of days.</p>
				<p>You&rsquo;ll gain access to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>2x12 weeks of workouts.</strong> Never worry about doing the same workout twice. You&rsquo;ll have your choice of bodyweight workouts or gym workouts.</li>
					<li><strong>Nutrition Guide.</strong> Understand the different foods you can eat and how to calculate your Macros (and what those are).</li>
					<li>Vitamins and supplements recommendations.</li>
					<li>Access to Private Facebook Group</li>
					<li><strong>Unlimited email support</strong> with Elisa for all of your questions and concerns</li>
					<li><strong>Online community</strong> where you can track your progress, share your progress, and provide support for other women taking the same journey</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The hardest part of any weight loss program isn&rsquo;t the workouts or the eating. It is sticking with it.</p>
				<p>It&rsquo;s okay to admit that you need that extra push. It is a lot easier when you feel like you are doing it with other women.</p>
				<p>You don&rsquo;t have to lose weight alone. Not this time.</p>

					<p>Elisa,</p>
					<p>I can&rsquo;t tell you how frustrated I was with everything in life.</p>
					<p>It seemed like that my unhappiness with my body bled out into other areas of my life.</p>
					<p>Every time I tried to lose weight I ran into roadblocks namely the one called life. My schedule is chaotic so it can be hard to plan consistent workouts.</p>
					<p><strong>Lose It, Love It, Leave It</strong> gave me my confidence and happiness back.</p>
					<p>I lost 20lbs and I have no intention of finding where I put it!</p>

					</div>
					<p>I am naturally skinny so my problem isn&rsquo;t losing weight, it is gaining it</p>
					<p>Doing your workouts and following your nutrition guide helped me gain muscles that I didn&rsquo;t even know existed!</p>
					<p>I no longer get people telling me that I need to eat more. Now people want to know how I got so toned.</p>
					<p>I am definitely in the <strong>Love It</strong> phase of Lose It, Leave It, Love It.</p>

					<p>Hi! My name is Elisa and I hate trying to lose weight. I am not really a fan of working out either.</p>
					<p>However, I want to look good and feel happy so that means eating right and working out.</p>
					<p>Over the past couple of years I have gained 20lbs, lost 15lbs, gained 5lbs, lost 7lbs, and many other ups and downs.</p>
					<p>It sucked until I found a group of women to work with.</p>
					<p>I realized that my problem was that I felt like I was alone on my journey. That&rsquo;s why I created the <strong>Lose It, Leave It, Love It</strong> Program.</p>
