				<p>Would you feed your pets stuff that could damage their bodies?</p>
				<p>Of course not, and yet we do this to ourselves every single day.</p>
				<p>When trying to lose weight the first thing that you should look into is sugar because it is one of the most damaging things you can put in your body.</p>
				<h2>Sugar Is the Enemy</h2>
				<p>Almost every diet finds a way to add sugar to your system. It doesn't have to be from cookies or cupcakes. It can be from breads, pastas, and even vegetables.</p>
				<p>Your body has become accustomed to running off of glucose (sugar broken down). <strong>That is why you have sugar cravings, afternoon fogginess, mood swings, and other things that you don't associate with sugar.</strong></p>
				<p>The Ketogenic Diet works to break that cycle so that your body is no longer reliant on glucose.</p>
				<p>How?</p>
				<p>By lowering carb consumption, making sure you get enough protein, and increasing the fats that you eat.</p>
				<h2>What Is the Ketogenic Diet?</h2>
				<p>The Ketogenic Diet is a low carb, moderate protein, and high fat diet. Yes, high fat.</p>
				<p>Contrary to what you've been taught over the years, fat isn't the problem, sugar is the problem.</p>
				<p>60% of our brain is made up of fat and you like your brain don't you?</p>
				<p><strong>The purpose of the ketogenic diet is to switch your body from being a sugar-burner to a fat-burner.</strong></p>
				<p>At most, your body can hold 600 g of glucose (what sugar gets converted into). That is about 1.3 lbs of fuel that your body can use before it needs to find more.</p>
				<p>That's why you are always on the hunt for more cabs.</p>
				<p>Fortunately, your body can store an almost unlimited amount of fat.</p>
				<p>When you become keto-adapted your body stops burning glucose for energy and instead, burns fat.</p>

					<p>Having a community of women following along on the same journey as me helped me lose 12 lbs. in the first 14 days.</p>
					<p>I loved the fact that you didn&rsquo;t tell me what I had to eat like most diets, but gave me guidelines on the 100s of different meals that I could prepare for myself that wouldn&rsquo;t set me back.</p>
					<p>Thank you, Elisa!</p>

					<p>The fact that I lost 14 lbs in the first 21 days should say enough about this program. I would love to say that it was because of the workout plan and eating right but without the support of the community I probably would&rsquo;ve quit after the first week.</p>
					<p>I don&rsquo;t need to sign up for this program again because you&rsquo;ve given me everything that I need but the fact you provide me with a chance to interact with others that share the same journey is something that I can&rsquo;t pass up.</p>
					<p>Expect to see me again next season!</p>

				<p>I've tried what feels like hundreds of different weight loss programs and they all had their pros and cons. Unfortunately, none of them helped to break me of my bad habits and I always found that I would gain the weight back quicker than I lose it.</p>
				<p><strong>That's when I decided to create a weight loss program of my own tailored to people that have faced the same struggle.</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>A program that doesn&rsquo;t pin you into a corner with what you can eat.</li>
					<li>A program that keeps workouts interesting and diverse.</li>
					<li>A program that offers a support system and community that you can turn to instead of trying to do it all on your own.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Say Hello to <span class="orange">The Keto Dash System</span></h2>
				<p>There are 3 goals for this life-changing program:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Lose It</strong>. Lose the unwanted weight.</li>
					<li><strong>Leave It</strong>. You aren&rsquo;t losing the weight so you can find it again. Leave it behind forever.</li>
					<li><strong>Love It</strong>. Most importantly, you need to love the process of losing weight and the results that you achieve.</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>Immediate Results</h3>
				<p><strong>This is a 21-day program but you will start seeing results in as little as 3 days.</strong></p>
				<p>So why is it 21 days?</p>
				<p>Because the best way to stick to a system that helps you improve your body is by seeing fast results. Once you've finish the 21 days you'll be provided with all of the knowledge and information needed to continue with this system for the rest of your life.</p>
				<h3>Continuous Community Support</h3>
				<p>The hardest part of any weight loss program isn&rsquo;t the workouts or the eating. It is sticking with it.</p>
				<p>It&rsquo;s okay to admit that you need that extra push. It is a lot easier when you feel like you are doing it with other women.</p>
				<p>You don&rsquo;t have to lose weight alone. Not this time.</p>
				<p><strong>That's why I made sure that the Keto Dash System has absolutely everything that you need to ensure your success.</strong> The only chance you have of failing is if you live inside a gingerbread house filled with candy and cookies.</p>

					<p>Elisa,</p>
					<p>I can&rsquo;t tell you how frustrated I was with everything in life.</p>
					<p>It seemed like that my unhappiness with my body bled out into other areas of my life.</p>
					<p>Every time I tried to lose weight I ran into roadblocks namely the one called life. My schedule is chaotic so it can be hard to plan consistent workouts.</p>
					<p><strong>The Keto Dash System</strong> gave me my confidence and happiness back.</p>
					<p>I lost 20 lbs in 3 weeks and I have no intention of finding where I put it!</p>

					<p>I am naturally skinny so my problem isn&rsquo;t losing weight, it is gaining it</p>
					<p>Doing your workouts and following your nutrition guide helped me gain muscles that I didn&rsquo;t even know existed!</p>
					<p>I no longer get people telling me that I need to eat more. Now people want to know how I got so toned.</p>

				<p>The Keto Dash System is meant to be much more than just a book on how to use the ketogenic diet to your advantage.</p>
				<p>It is a complete system meant to help you prevent any self-sabotage that you might want to try while trying to lose weight.</p>
				<h2>How Does the Keto Dash System Work?</h2>
				<p>I've broken up the Keto Dash System into seasons because I think <strong>one of the best ways to lose weight is with other people.</strong></p>
				<p>Trying to lose weight and completely changing your eating habits can be a very lonely experience. That is why you won't be doing it alone.</p>
				<h3>A Whole New Group of Buddies</h3>
				<p>Each season of the Keto Dash System gives a new group of people the chance to change their lives and discover a whole lifestyle.</p>
				<p>Once you enroll in the Keto Dash System, you will be given access to the community and private group (opens January 3rd). You'll also be provided with the information that you need to prepare you for when the Keto Dash beings on January 10th.</p>
				<p>That way, you have a week to get yourself prepared by buying the right foods, planning out your meals, and getting your mentality in check.</p>
				<p>From there you start a 21-day journey with others where you can share your progress, see how others are doing, and enjoy your new life. Every day you will receive a new encouraging email from me helping you to push forward.</p>
				<p><strong>Even better, when your season ends, you will still have access to the community so you are never alone in your journey.</strong></p>

					<h3>Benefits of the Ketogenic Diet</h3>
					<p>While the ketogenic diet has been used by doctors to help treat patients for over 50 years, it is only just now starting to get noticed by the mainstream health community.</p>
					<p>The most obvious benefit of the ketogenic diet is that it helps you lose weight, but people are quickly discovering that it helps their bodies in so many other ways:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Freedom from hypoglycemia, food fixations, and sugar cravings</li>
						<li>Lack of hunger</li>
						<li>Lower blood pressure</li>
						<li>Drop in cholesterol</li>
						<li>Increase in HDL Cholesterol (this is a good thing)</li>
						<li>A drop in triglycerides</li>
						<li>More energy</li>
						<li>Decrease in stiffness and joint pain</li>
						<li>Clearer thinking</li>
						<li>Improvement in sleep apnea symptoms</li>
						<li>Heartburn relief</li>
						<li>Prevention of gum dieseas</li>
						<li>Improved digestion</li>
						<li>Mood stabilization</li>
					</ul>
					<p>These reasons are why the ketogenic diet is more than just a diet, it is a lifestyle change.</p>

				<p>If you have a question that isn&rsquo;t answered below you can send an email to <a mailto="elisa@thrivestrive.com">elisa@thrivestrive.com</a> and I will respond as soon as possible.</p>	
				<h2>Questions?</h2>
				<p><strong>What if I can&rsquo;t make it to the gym?</strong><br>The beauty of the ketogenic diet is that it switches your body to be a fat-burner instead of a sugar-burner. That means everything that you do that requires energy (which is everything that you do!), your body will burn fat to get that energy instead of relying on sugar.</p>
				<p>While the best results happen when you mix the ketogenic diet with some form of exercise, exercise is not necessary to start seeing results.</p>
				<p><strong>Is this really different from other weight loss programs?</strong><br>Yes! I've made sure that this program focuses on providing you with a support system that will help you across the finish line.</p>
				<p>If you&rsquo;re just looking for a diet and want to do it alone then you can read all of the free content on this site.</p>
				<p>In fact, I will be following the program along with you!</p>
				<p><strong>Is there a guarantee?</strong><br>Of course! If you can show that you stuck with Keto Dash for 21 days and have not lost the weight that I promised just let me know and I will personally issue you a prompt and courteous refund - no questions asked.</p>

					<p>Hi! My name is Elisa and I hate trying to lose weight. I am not really a fan of working out either.</p>
					<p>However, I want to look good and feel happy so that means eating right and working out.</p>
					<p>Over the past couple of years I have gained 20lbs, lost 15lbs, gained 5lbs, lost 7lbs, and many other ups and downs.</p>
					<p>It sucked until I found a group of women to work with.</p>
					<p>I realized that my problem was that I felt like I was alone on my journey. That&rsquo;s why I created the <strong>Keto Dash System</strong>.</p>
